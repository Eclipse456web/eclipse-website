      <h2>What is Eclipse Tower?</h2>
      <p>
        Eclipse Tower is an ancient structure that stands at the heart of a crumbling realm, once the center of peace and power. Now, it's a cursed beacon drawing in those seeking truth, power, or redemption. Legends speak of a force sealed within the tower that could reshape the world—or end it.
      </p>

      <h2>The World</h2>
      <p>
        The land of Virelia was torn apart by a celestial war between light and shadow. The remnants of that battle gave birth to Eclipse Tower. The tower warps the space around it, creating realms within realms. Many who enter, never return.
      </p>

      <h2>The Curse</h2>
      <p>
        Those who come close to the tower are marked by a mysterious glyph that burns into their skin. It grants great power, but corrupts the mind. These cursed are known as "The Bound." Some fight it, some embrace it.
